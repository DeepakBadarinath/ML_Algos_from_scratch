# ML_Algos_from_scratch
A few ML algos implemented from scratch 

1) Linear_Regression_Fake_data-: Data is generated from a Gaussian Distribution and Linear regression and classification is implemented by hand

2) Logistic_Regression_Iris_data-: Logistic Regression is implemented by hand and used on iris data from UCI

3) SVM_exponential data -: Support vector machines are implemented by hand and used in classification of exponentially generated random data

4) SVM_kernel_Exp_data-: Kernelized versions of SVMS are implemented by hand and used in classifying exponentially generated random data

5) SVM_LLS_logistic...-: SVM and Logistic regression are implemented by hand on exponentially generated random data and performance is compared
